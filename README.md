# Introduction
This project enables continuous monitoring of the home network for suspicious activity within the network. The traffic is captured and stored on the system to be analyzed and displayed on the Evebox dashboard. The purpose of this project is to monitor and identify any unusual activities in order to block any malicious outgoing connections that may be putting the entire home network at risk. 
Suricata has been used as a network intrusion detection system capturing traffic from IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
In order to elegantly present this, Evebox dashboard has been used making this similar to a SIEM system. Visualization and alerting has been set up so that the system administrator can observe which devices are exhibiting suspicious behaviour and proceed accordingly.
